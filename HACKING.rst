Overall Design
==============

The macro expander itself is a set-of-scopes expander, based on
`Matthew Flatt's paper`_ from POPL 2016 and described quite accessibly in
his talk from `Strange Loop`_.

Additionally, there is a module system patterned after `Racket's`_.

This macro expander has a few differences:

* Rather than performing a depth-first traversal of the input syntax,
  expanding as it goes, our expander maintains a queue of expansion
  tasks. Tasks indicate the expression to be expanded as well as its
  resulting location in the final output. Dependency information is
  tracked in order to constrain the scheduling of expansion tasks.

* The core language does not coincide with the input language. Having
  an independent core language will hopefully allow us to overcome the
  overhead associated with recursive uses of ``local-expand``, as well
  as enabling a second, trusted type checking pass.

* Type checking and macro expansion are interleaved. Every expansion
  step in an expression or pattern context knows what type the
  resulting program will have.

The type checker is a mostly-vanilla Hindley-Milner, based on
Sestoft's description in `Programming Language Concepts`_, extended
with user-definable datatypes and Racket-style phase stratification of
bindings. It uses RÃ©my's optimization_ of generalization, where type
metavariables are assigned levels to avoid scanning the context at
generalization time.
