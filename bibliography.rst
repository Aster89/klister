Macros and module systems
-------------------------

The overall macro expander uses Flatt's set-of-scopes algorithm for hygiene: https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/popl16-f.pdf

The module system is based on Racket's: https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/macromod.pdf

We'd like to find a way to do the things described in `Macros that Work Together`_, but with types. It's mostly just design sketches so far for us. We expect that we can adapt the design of `MetaPRL's resources`_ to replace compile-time bindings, at least.

Type checker implementation
---------------------------

The type checker is based on Sestoft's description in `Programming Language Concepts`_. It uses RÃ©my's optimization_ of generalization, where type metavariables are assigned levels to avoid scanning the context at generalization time.

LVars have been used to `parallelize type checkers`_.

These systems have some form of type-aware hygienic macro, or other typed metaprogramming.

`Lean's macros`_ are the closest thing to Klister right now.

MetaML
~~~~~~

MetaML_ is a staged programming system rather than a macro system, but it pays to be familiar with it.

.. _MetaML: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(00)00053-0

MacroML
~~~~~~~

MacroML_ compiles down to MetaML, and thus provides very strong guarantees. It's less expressive than a full procedural macro system, though.
